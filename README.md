# Getting Started

### Plugin requirements if you use VSCode
Some plugins are required to follow some code guidelines that the project have configured

1. [Editor config](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
2. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

After that, keep in mind the following points:

- To install the project dependencies start the follow command: `npm install`

- To run the server to start development, you need to run: `npm start`

- The server will run at: [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

And that is all, happy coding!
